# AntsAndDragons

A simple simulation of a board with ants and dragons that move on it. The ants seek food and they omit dragons while the dragons hunt for the ants.
The creatures inform each other about food/hazards that they see. The project was made for "Programowanie obiektowe" (Object-oriented programming) classes.
