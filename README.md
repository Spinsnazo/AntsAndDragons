# AntsAndDragons

A simple simulation of a board with ants and dragons that move on it. The ants seek food and they omit the dragons while the dragons hunt for the ants.
The creatures inform each other about food/hazards that they see. The first version of the project was done for "Programowanie obiektowe" (Object-oriented programming) classes.
